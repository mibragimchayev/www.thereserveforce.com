title: "Reserve Benefits"
---

There are a lot of financial, health, and other benefits that you get when joining a reserve component of the United States Military.
Here's a breakdown of some of those benefits.


## Drill Pay

Payment depends on rank and years of service.
Unlike active duty, reserve members are paid once a month instead of the 1st and 15th of the month.
Reservists are also only paid if they complete one or more drills during the month.
A typical reserve weekend consists of 4 drill periods.
Each drill period is a half-day of work.
You can view the current reserve pay chart [here](/all/pay-chart/).


## Reserve Retirement

Members of the reserve may request to retire after 20 cumulative years of qualifying service.
Unlike their active duty counterparts, reserve/national guard retirement pay begins at age 60 instead of immediately following retirement (or at a lower qualifying age in cases where a member completed active duty service).


## Group Life Insurance

Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) is available to all members of the reserve.
The SGLI provides low-cost term life insurance coverage in $50,000 increments up to a maximum of $400,000.

- If you choose to opt into SGLI coverage, you will pay a monthly premium that is automatically deducted from your base pay.
The current rate is 7 cents per $1,000 of insurance.
If you choose to receive the max amount of $400,000, you will have $28 deducted from your monthly drill pay.

FSGLI provides term life insurance coverage to spouses, qualifying biological and adopted children, and step-children of service members participating in the SGLI.
The service member will pay the premium for spousal coverage and dependant children are insured at no cost.


## Medical and Dental Insurance

TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) is a voluntary, premium-based medical health care plan available to all reservists in an inactive status and their families.
It is comparable to TRICARE Prime available at no cost to service members on active duty.

TRICARE Dental is a voluntary, premium-based dental insurance plan available to all reservists in an inactive status and their families.
